# ReWriteX

ReWriteX is an AI-assisted writing copilot that rewrites, humanizes, and audits content for originality. The project includes a Groq-powered Node/Express backend and a Vite/React frontend styled with Tailwind CSS.

## ✨ Features
- **Paraphrase & Humanize** – Rewrite text with configurable synonym strength.
- **AI Detection** – Classify likelihood that text was generated by AI.
- **Plagiarism Insights** – Estimate similarity against public sources.
- **Full Report** – Combine paraphrasing, AI detection, plagiarism, and editorial insights in one view.
- **Responsive UI** – Side-by-side input/output with animated ReWriteX branding.

## 🚀 Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ (v22 recommended)
- npm 9+

### Clone & Install
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Astrionix/REwriteX.git
cd REwriteX

# Install backend deps
cd backend
npm install

# Install frontend deps
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

### Environment Variables
Create `.env` files (never commit them!)

`backend/.env`
```
PORT=5000
GROQ_API_KEY=your-groq-api-key
GROQ_PARAPHRASE_MODEL=llama-3.3-70b-versatile
GROQ_HUMANIZE_MODEL=llama-3.3-70b-versatile
GROQ_AI_DETECT_MODEL=qwen/qwen3-32b
GROQ_PLAGIARISM_MODEL=groq/compound
GROQ_INSIGHT_MODEL=llama-3.3-70b-versatile
```

`frontend/.env`
```
VITE_API_BASE=http://localhost:5000
```

## 🧪 Running Locally
In two terminals:

**Backend**
```bash
cd backend
npm start
```

**Frontend**
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```
Visit `http://localhost:5173` in your browser.

## 📦 Production Build
- Backend: deploy `backend/` to Node-compatible host. Start command `npm start`.
- Frontend: run `npm run build` in `frontend/` and deploy `dist/` to static host (set `VITE_API_BASE` to backend URL).

## 🔐 Safety Tips
- Keep API keys in environment variables.
- Rotate credentials regularly.
- Monitor backend logs (Groq errors will be printed to console).
